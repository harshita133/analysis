Thank you for joining our discussion of Potash Corp.'s first quarter performance. We appreciate this opportunity to share our views on the conditions that underpinned our record results and the drivers that have us preparing for the next stage of growth."", 'With rising global food demand and inventories for a number of crops under increasing pressure, prices for agricultural commodities continued to strengthen in the quarter. This further enhanced our already attractive crop returns, giving farmers in all major growing regions of the world the motivation to focus on soil fertility to maximize crop yield potential. The demand resurgence that began in the second half of 2010 escalated as fertilizer buyers in both domestic and offshore markets moved to secure much-needed potash phosphate and nitrogen supplies for their farmer customers. As a result, sales volumes and prices rose for all three nutrients during the quarter, leading to the highest first quarter earnings in our history.', 'Potash, our core nutrient, generated nearly 70% of our record first quarter gross margin of $1.1 billion. Our potash sales volumes of 2.8 million tonnes represented the second-highest total for any quarter in our history, a clear indication of the renewed global demand for this nutrient.', 'Canpotex, the offshore marketing company for Saskatchewan potash, sold record volumes during the quarter. Almost 3/4 of its sales were to spot markets in Latin America and Asian countries outside of China and India, a reflection of the importance of these large and growing markets to our business.', 'We sold 1.1 million tonnes to North American customers, our second-highest first quarter total. With demand strengthening and supply tightening, prices in North America and offshore markets rose. As pleased as we are with the continued improvement in market conditions during the quarter, we see it as a precursor to even greater opportunities as we move forward.', ""Today, as farmers in the northern hemisphere head into a new planting season, there's significant pressure on the world supply of a wide range of crops. At an estimated 18.9%, the global grains stocks-to-use ratio is once again approaching record low levels. This is sparking a need for increased production and improved fertilization practices. The United States Department of Agriculture recently forecast that by the end of the 2010/2011 crop year, U.S. corn supplies will be down to 18 days of use and soybeans to 15 days. These are record lows and less than half of the historical average supply for these crops."", ""In China, the government has recently taken the step of limiting industrial corn usage in an attempt to avoid depletion of already low inventories. Still, the state grain trading agency, COBCOE, said last week that it expects to face a corn supply shortage this decade. This is being driven primarily by a growing need for animal feed as over the next 10 years, China's pork demand is forecast to rise 26% to 29%, and milk demand is expected to double."", 'More importantly, concerns related to food supplies are not an isolated issue to one country or one region. Now it is a global issue, and there are no quick fixes. Stocks have been under pressure for more than a decade as we have consumed more than we have produced. And with demand continuing to rise, it will take more than one large harvest to relieve this pressure. This is true not only of grains and oilseeds as cotton, sugar, palm oil, coffee and other key global crops are also facing tight supplies, creating real competition for acres. This is a very different environment then the one we saw in the summer of 2008 when the strength of crop prices was less widespread and partially driven by government export restrictions and record oil prices.', ""When the global economic downturn struck, the commodities market, like many other asset sectors, tumbled. In the aftermath of the downturn, the world has witnessed that the underlying drivers of food demand have not abated. The world's food producers need to keep the pedal to the metal to protect the world's food supply, and higher prices are needed to encourage them to do so. While we believe crop prices will remain elevated for the foreseeable future, this does not mean we need $7 corn and $14 soybeans on a sustained basis to keep farmers motivated."", 'In fact, as illustrated on Slide 5 of our presentation, farmers who were historically accustomed to $2 or $3 corn can generate very healthy returns on their investment even when prices are, for example, at $4 a bushel. We expect to see farmers working to capitalize on the economic opportunity that exist today and in the years ahead.', 'In the second quarter, we anticipate strong demand for all three nutrients as growers around the world work to address soil fertility in an effort to maximize crop production. Cool, wet conditions in North America have resulted in a late start to spring planting, but modern equipment can facilitate efficient and rapid seeding progress when weather improves, so farmers here still have sufficient time to complete seeding. Given the current crop economics, we believe that North American farmers will have added incentive to seed and fertilize every possible acre this spring.', 'After traveling in Brazil last month, I can tell you there is tremendous excitement about agriculture in that country. Farmers there are moving quickly to capture the benefits of current conditions, driving strong demand for our products. Potash demand in Latin America is expected to reach approximately 10 million tonnes this year, including record Brazilian imports of around 7 million tonnes. The market at times fixates on developments in only China and India, but what it often overlooks is the growth and importance of markets in other Asian countries, which currently account for over 40% of Canpotex total potash sales.', ""Countries like Indonesia and Malaysia are purchasing aggressively to take advantage of highly supportive prices for crops such as palm oil and sugar cane, which are heavy potash users. As I mentioned earlier, China's food demand is growing, and there is significant pressure to increase food production levels. New potash contracts will be required to ensure China's supply needs can be met in the second half of 2011. We expect negotiations will get underway in May or early June."", 'Despite comments from officials in India about reducing imports in the hope that potash prices will pull back, inventory levels in India remain low and the agronomic need for potash in that country is well known. In fact, few countries have more nutrient deficient soils than India. We believe that buyers and farmers will apply pressure to ensure supply is available for the upcoming planting season.', 'At the same time, other countries are not waiting for India and are staking their claim to limited supply. And as a result, Canpotex is now largely committed through the second quarter.', 'With significant recovery in demand that has taken place, we believe most global potash producers are operating at or near their capacity in an effort to keep pace with demand. North American potash production in the first quarter approached record levels, yet producer inventories fell more than 10% during the quarter, and are currently 26% below the five-year average. These tight supply/demand fundamentals are supporting higher global prices for potash.', 'In February, Canpotex has announced separate increases totaling $80 per tonne to spot markets in Asia and Latin America. As these increases take hold, the earnings potential from our Potash business will continue to unfold.', ""Our long-term potash expansion program, which we initiated in 2003, will give us additional tonnes at a time when the world most needs new production. We have wrapped up construction on five projects, including Phase I of a two-part expansion at our Cory facility. Work is well underway on our remaining projects. And by the end of 2012, we expect construction at New Brunswick and Allan, and the majority of our total capital spending will be complete. By 2014, we will be finished construction on our project at Rocanville, and we'll have ramped up production on all expansion projects by 2015."", ""As our company and our contractors have worked through these projects, we have gained new insights into the time and capital requirements of new capacity. We have very experienced people. We believe they're the best in the Potash business working on our projects. They can tell you that there are no shortcuts to bringing new productive capacity online. In the race to meet global demand, Potash Corp. has a big head start, as many other producers are just in the planning or early phases of their expansion programs. By 2015, we anticipate our operational capability will be 17.1 million tonnes, an increase of more than 50% from our current level. Our increased capability will be a key differentiator during a time of very strong agricultural markets."", 'As we look ahead to the remainder of this year, we expect second quarter net income to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.90 per share and full year earnings to be in the range of $3 to $3.40 per share. The growing demand for our products and the availability of our new operational capability give us tremendous earnings potential in the months and years ahead. Our goal is to maximize long-term value for our shareholders, and we never let a record quarter or the pursuit of short-term gains influence the way we think.', ""Our track record in this area is very well known and so are the results. Potash Corp.'s total shareholder return over the past 10 years is approximately 1,800%. Over that same timeframe, the return from the Dow Jones industrial average was 47%. As excited as we are about current conditions, we continue to make decisions and build a company that captures the greatest possible value for an asset base that can extend for generations and reward all of our stakeholders and those who depend on us."", ""Thank you for your interest in Potash Corp.

And actually I think that you're going to see a stress here on the ability of the industry to be able to supply the demand outs. I wouldn't be surprised actually to see a short situation before the end of the year. There's just so much pressure on the global food supply really across the total geography that we service. I mean, just every country is under severe pressure. And different than the last time or times before where you've seen high prices for one or two commodities that would inspire growers to plant additional acres of say, corn or beans. Now those ag commodity prices are strong across the board. So you're not seeing a whole lot of diversion of acres. And so every country has their specialties. I mean, if you look at the U.S., of course, the biggest, still the biggest market for us, corn, wheat, soybeans, which you go to Brazil and you look a smorgasbord of capabilities that they have in agriculture. Obviously, soybeans we think 72 million tonnes of soybeans produced this year. But if you look at coffee, citrus, sugar, Brazil just unbelievable developments there. So we're going to see these pressures, and so if you start looking at markets where we think that you're going to -- I mean, if you rate them in terms of shipments, North America is right up at the top in terms of imports. China would be the largest market in the world. China we think is going to be close to 7 million tonnes of imports this year. Brazil, again, 7 million tonnes of imports this year, which would be a record. India, we don't know exactly. They're somewhere in the 6.3 to 6.5 million tonnes of India, which would represent their total Potash business because they have no indigenous production. But then you start looking at -- we cover other Asia but if you think about Indonesia, you're up 2.25 million tonnes. Malaysia, you're 1.75 million tonnes. Vietnam, you're looking at 700,000 tonnes. Thailand, 480,000, 500,000 tonnes. Korea, Japan, up in the 550,000, 600,000 tonnes. All of these -- and what I was saying is we tend to get fixated on India and China, but these other markets are huge markets and growing markets. And if you think Thailand, #1 rice exporter in the world; Vietnam second largest rice exporter in the world. These people have tremendous need for potash to be able to grow those crops. So I think you're going to be stretched here to supply this. It wouldn't surprise me to see that number in the 58m close. If you get any inventory replenishment, you could be also closer to 60 and I think that really stresses global capability to supply.""]",question_answer

We don't get into talking about our costs too much, Ben. I hope you can appreciate that. But in terms of looking at the price differential between standard and granular, there's a reason why there should be a price differential. It's shrunk over the years. If you go back 15, 20 years ago, you had $20 to $30 price differential between standard and granular. I mean, if you look at the at the cost of compactors, if you look at energy costs, it's just a tremendous difference between that and producing a ton of standards. You just really need to see a wider differential, and plus the pressure on granular markets is so much greater today because the demand is there.

You start thinking about the return, and fertilizer as a percentage of revenue from crops sold today is about as good a deal as you could possibly get. I mean, if you just take corn, for example, at $7 corn, fertilizer represents just a little over 12% of the cost. So that is just a very low level. If you go back and look at where we were historically with $3 or less, you're talking then about 30% fertilizer cost as a percentage of revenue. $4 corn, 22%. So with these higher prices for -- that's just one example but I mean the return on investment for fertilizer, for potash specifically is very, very real. And I don't think there's anyone thinking about demand destruction at the price levels we are today. And I'm a big believer that over the long term, that the price of potash has to have something to do with the cost of making it. And so you start thinking about the capital cost involved and I said earlier in my formal remarks that no one's done more of this than we have, and so we are really up to date on what these costs are. And I'm going to be very happy that we have our construction done by 2014 because the people that are looking at this 2015 to 2020 and beyond are going to get a rude awakening about costs. And what you're seeing now is a lot of pressure. I mean, just out here in Western Canada, we've got oil sands coming back, a lot of labor pressure building again, and you better have some pretty good contingency costs built into your remodel because you're going to be looking at some extraordinary costs of building these projects. But if you just take the last forecast of what it would take to produce a 2 million tonne project, to build a 2 million tonne project that came from AMEC, which is the leading engineering company looking at these things today, they're talking $4.1 billion within the plant gate. And then you add about $1.5 billion for infrastructure, talking terminals, rail, water, gas, town, the whole deal. You're talking $5.5 billion. So if you're looking at return on investment in a tax jurisdiction like Saskatchewan, which has the best potash in the world and you take a 10% return on that $5.5 billion number, you need a price FOB mine of $700. And we're at $366 average for this quarter. So you're about halfway home. And then if you're like us and you think that 10% too skinny and because you've got an eight-year window and you've got capital sitting out there for all of those years, you better have a 15% return because you don't know what your total cost exposure is going to be for some of the reasons, labor and others, that I talked about. Inflation, I think we're going to have a little of that over the next 10 years. Then you're looking at what I think is a much more reasonable number of 15% return on $5.5 billion. You've got $1,000 FOB mine. So $366 doesn't cut it, and that's why you're not seeing any greenfield in the world today because you don't have the economic justification to build it. And you don't do this on a hope. It's like the people that are camping out in front of Westminster Abbey today and thinking they've got a wedding invitation to the wedding tomorrow. Those hopes don't work so well. So I just think you really have to look at this realistically.""]",question_answer

It's important to remember that India has one of the worst N to K ratios of any major agricultural country in the world, and it has no indigenous potash production capability. You have to increase potash applications in India. The ratio of N to K is about 6:1 and if you think in the U.S. it’s 2:1. Most countries would tell you that they need to get to 3:1 so 6:1, you're just really going to have low yields with that type of ratio. So you have to put down more potash to improve yields within India, and it's going to be a very important issue if the country is going to avoid serious food inflation and the political problems, which would result from that outcome. And if you look at just where we are today, the Indian government supported subsidy prices at almost $100 a tonne below the market price. I know that certain Indian government officials do not believe that the market should apply to them. That's kind of like denying gravity. I mean, it's just a -- the market works and unfortunately, we have seen once again, certain people refer to cartelization of the potash industry and of course, this accusation is just ridiculous, not true and really not helpful in the negotiation process. We only hear these charges when the market is increasing. When the market declined in 2009, in 2010 there were no such charges. So you just have to take that with a little bit of, certainly a grain of salt. But the bottom line is we're partners with our Indian customers, and the important task of ensuring enough food is produced. We work very hard to try to be a reliable supplier for them. And I’d just say as, I said earlier, the price of potash over the long term simply has to reflect the cost. And if we don't do that, we're going to have more volatility and that certainly won't please our Indian customers, and that's certainly not anything that we want. So I'm very confident we'll have a new contract with our Indian friends. And whether that's done at the EFA meeting in Montréal here at the end of May or in June, it will be done, and I can tell you from our side, there's absolutely no pressure on us whatsoever. We're largely sold out for the second quarter, and we've got some shutdowns coming up in the third quarter. We've got some tie-ins. We're going to tie in the new head frame at Allan, and that's going to take us out a little bit in terms of production. So as I said before, you don't want to deny markets and supply/demand really does work, and so we just have to get on with it. And it's really the only country in the world that we see any more -- China's, that’s gone by the wayside. We don't have any emotional apart to the negotiating process. I think we'll all be well served when that goes by the wayside with India as well.""]",question_answer

Every year is different. I would say that most springs in the last 37 years that I've been focused on this business have been more like this one. Last year was an anomaly. They can plant awful fast. We're seeing -- it looks like we're going to get a little window opened up next week. But if you think that corn planting can be done about 5% a day, so if you think you get one good week, you plant 35% of the corn crop in the United States, they can move awfully quickly, and they got this tremendous equipment and capability to plant. So we think that there, as I said in my formal remarks, that they will plant every acre and fertilize it too because they don't want to miss the yield potential. We did have a good fall last year and open fogs, we had an early harvest so there were people that put product down last fall. We had spreading on frozen ground there a little bit during the winter time, but there's still a lot of work to do. So I think it's way too early to pull the panic plug on the spring season. We think we're still going to have a good spring season. Inventories, really no inventory build whatsoever. And I would say globally, it's just the product is going to the ground, and we haven't seen inventory replenishment yet.""]",question_answer

So it makes a significant difference on a one-time basis. The government of Saskatchewan, the current government, which is the Saskatchewan party has reiterated on a number of occasions that they fully support the existing tax regime. There is an election in November, and so I wouldn't expect there would be anything that would come out of any tax changes through that period of time. And generally, I would say that from a distant third-party perspective, it would appear at this stage, unlikely that, that party in power would not repeat itself for a four-year cycle. Obviously, you can never be sure about what would happen but they are doing fairly strongly in the polls and they see the full benefit of the capital spending that we're doing in Saskatchewan. In terms of the job creation, we're doing $6.5 billion in Saskatchewan alone. The other two players are -- probably would get that total up to $10 billion to $12 billion, which is actually generating significant benefits for the province. In fact, if you take a look at the increased personal income tax and the increased sales tax that the government of Saskatchewan is getting right now, it actually makes up more than the one-time deduction on the PPT. So the government on a holistic total revenue perspective basis is actually much better off enjoying these expansions and getting higher total tax revenue as a result. So it's something to watch, but I don't think it's something that we have – that’s a huge risk at this stage.""]",question_answer
