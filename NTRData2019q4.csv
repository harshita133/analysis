2,35,NTR.TO,NTR.TO_208052,4,2020-02-19 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2019,2019,1650,Charles Victor Magro,"[""Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. The fourth quarter was the continuation of a challenging year in agriculture driven by geopolitical issues, short-term weather anomalies and other market drivers. These headwinds virtually eliminated all global growth for crop inputs in 2019 and set back the cyclical recovery we started to see in 2018.In the fourth quarter, we experienced another condensed fall application window and associated price weakness. But looking forward into 2020, we expect global ag markets to recover as we move through the year. Overall, we are positive on crop input demand this spring across North America. This is due to the expected increase in seeded acreage, improved cash crop margins and farmers wanting to catch up on fertilizer applications after the past 3 seasons with a suboptimal window.The recent U.S.-China trade agreement has also improved U.S. farmer sentiment. For potash, we expect a rebound in global demand driven by increases in the U.S. and Southeast Asia, with stronger applications in Indonesia and Malaysia due to the dramatic rise in palm oil prices over the past 4 months. However, short-term shipments to China remain uncertain as they draw down port inventory, and the coronavirus has limited product movement.For nitrogen, U.S. prices have shown signs of recovery, and we anticipate strong global demand to provide stability in 2020 despite the recent impact from lower global energy prices. Nutrien was created to withstand the variances in the global crop input markets that can arise from time to time. We have the ability to generate more stable earnings than our peers and to make highly accretive investments through the cycle while still maintaining our ability to capture significant leverage to higher fertilizer volumes and prices as the markets improve.We captured $650 million in synergies from the merger and continue to execute on our strategic plan despite the headwinds experienced in the second half of the year. We also generated significant free cash flow for both the quarter and the year, with $2.6 billion in free cash flow or $4.54 per share, which was supported by a reduction in working capital. Even after excluding changes in working capital, we generated $2.2 billion in free cash flow in 2019 or $3.70 per share.Our adjusted net debt to EBITDA was 2.5x, which is essentially at the middle of our target range, and this is in a year which we would consider to be near or at the bottom of the cycle. We also purchased over 36 million shares in 2019 and continue to be active in the market in 2020.Now let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter results. Total adjusted EBITDA was up modestly in 2019 due to good results from our Retail business, solid operational performance, the continued benefit from merger synergies and a focus on cost control. This more than offset the impact from the significant weather challenges in North America and Australia, trade uncertainties and the softening of global fertilizer market conditions in the second half of 2019.Nutrien's adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $664 million after accounting for a number of charges totaling $128 million related to M&A activities. The largest of these was about $50 million charge related to the Ruralco acquisition. This will also be the last quarter that items related to the merger will be reported on.On a business unit basis, our Retail Q4 EBITDA was 8% higher in the fourth quarter of 2019 than last year and 2% higher on an annual basis. Gross margins in the fourth quarter were higher year-over-year across every Retail category. North American retail fertilizer volumes in the fourth quarter were similar to last year, but there were significant regional differences. U.S. retail fertilizer sales volumes in the fourth quarter were 20% higher year-over-year compared to the compressed season in 2018.Farmers in the Corn Belt, particularly the Eastern and Southern Corn Belts, were applying fertilizer right up until New Year's. However, this was fully offset by significantly lower volumes in Western Canada and some Northern U.S. states due to an early winter. We had great success with the launch of our -- and adoption of our new digital platform in 2019. At the end of the year, we had customers representing over 60% of our North American revenue signed up. They made $260 million of purchases online in 2019, results that are unprecedented in the ag retail industry.Potash EBITDA was down 62% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2018 due to lower prices and sales volumes and higher per tonne cost as we took downtime at a number of our facilities to better match supply with the temporary reduction in global demand. The CN Rail strike also lowered earnings by approximately $10 million this quarter. On an annual basis, 2019 Potash adjusted EBITDA was similar to 2018, as higher average selling prices were offset by lower sales volumes.Nitrogen EBITDA this quarter was 19% lower year-over-year due to lower ammonia volumes and sales prices. The narrow window for applying ammonia in Canada and the northern tier of the U.S. this fall had a major impact on our volumes and our earnings. We estimate we lost 110,000 tonnes of ammonia sales due to an early onset of winter in this very important market. As we have seen before, this will result in an increase in demand for nitrogen product applications this spring. For the year, Nitrogen EBITDA increased 2% as lower natural gas costs in North America and higher earnings from our equity investments more than offset lower ammonia sales volumes and lower nitrogen realized prices.Despite depressed phosphate prices in the second half of 2019, our business continued to generate positive cash margins for both the quarter and the year, thanks to our product mix and merger synergies, including our decision to convert the Redwater phosphate facility to an ammonium sulfate facility. While fertilizer markets have started 2020 under pressure, there are several positive factors to consider for the crop input market as we look towards the spring season.The U.S. ag market should fully recover as we expect more than 14 million additional acres to be seeded this spring, or about a 6% increase from last year. Almost all of those additional acres will be planted to corn and soybeans. A second positive development is the resolution of the U.S.-China trade dispute. While it is uncertain when we will see U.S. agricultural exports rise, there is little doubt it will be a significant improvement relative to the past 2 years.On the market outlook for potash, we expect to see strong demand in North America as our potash winter fill program achieved the targeted volumes quickly, and we were sold out of potash for the first quarter within a matter of weeks. Globally, we also expect that the dramatic increase in palm oil prices over the past 3 or 4 months will result in a rebound in potash demand from Southeast Asia after imports dropped in that region by 2 million tonnes in 2019. However, we now expect China will not conclude a new contract until sometime in the second quarter due to elevated port inventories and the impact that the coronavirus is having on product movement in the country. As a result, we have lowered our 2020 Chinese fertilizer shipment estimate by 1 million tonnes from earlier estimates.Our new forecast for global potash demand in 2020 is 66 million to 68 million tonnes, which represents about a 4% increase over 2019 levels. As such, our sales plan this year is intended to support our customers in these growing markets, with our sales anticipated to be between 12.3 million and 12.7 million tonnes.For nitrogen, we anticipate North American prices will be supported by a surge in demand this spring and lower offshore imports.While this was a tough quarter for the industry, Nutrien stayed focused on our strategic priorities. We were excited to close the Ruralco acquisition and to announce the Australian rebranding, uniting all of our global retail operations under the name Nutrien Ag Solutions. We expect Ruralco and other acquisitions made in 2019 to add over $125 million to Retail EBITDA this year.We also foresee strong organic growth for Retail, assuming normal weather and seeded acreage, plus the benefit from ongoing investments in our digital platform and supply chain improvements. We also announced the purchase of Agrosema, an ag retailer in Southern Brazil with 12 farm centers and 200 employees, servicing thousands of farm customers. And we expect more of these types of acquisitions in Brazil in 2020.We will continue to focus on developing our leading position in digital agriculture. We are aiming to approach $0.5 billion in sales through the digital platform in North America this year, essentially doubling last year's level and leading the industry in online revenue generation. We will also be rolling out our sustainable agricultural strategy, supported by our climate-smart investments. We have invested across the value chain in products, services and technologies that can make a significant and positive contribution to sustainable agriculture and to our bottom line. This will be a multipronged approach, including new ag, biological and nature-based products, best available carbon-reduction technologies, and carbon capture and sequestration, both in our upstream and downstream operations.This also extends to our new digital tools that help growers make more informed decisions, which encompasses our recent acquisitions of Agrible and Waypoint. We will leverage these type of investments as we build a company-wide sustainability strategy that is integrated into the long-term plans for our company. We will be rolling out the details of this strategy, along with specific targets, later in 2020.We continue to believe our business model will perform well in times of volatility. Our strong cash generation will allow us to grow our operations while returning capital to shareholders, with the focus clearly set on long-term value creation.We are issuing EBITDA guidance of $3.8 billion to $4.3 billion in 2020, which assumes a solid growth in Retail earnings, but recognizing that fertilizer prices are likely to continue to be under pressure in the first half of the year, given current levels and the lag in price realization compared to quoted benchmark prices.We see 2020 as a year that will start to demonstrate the momentum back towards the path of recovery for global fertilizer markets, which started in 2018. We will continue to remain disciplined in our approach to capital, to controlling our controllables, including our investment in production decisions.With that, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions.""]",management_discussion

Jacob, so when we report on same-store sales, as you probably know, it's an adjusted number, so we adjust for both FX and for fertilizer price, which last year we had appreciation. And so on a global basis on the 12 months, we did see a 1% decline. If you look at the U.S. market specifically, our same-store sales adjusted are up about 2%. So we actually had really strong performance in the U.S. We were down in Canada. As you may know, in Western Canada, we really lost the fourth quarter window for both herbicide application and fertilizer. And so that ended up hurting our same-store sales in Canada.

So the best numbers we have on an industry basis is in the U.S., again, which is our biggest market. We do get point-of-sale data on crop protection sales, so we have a really good understanding of the performance of our business in U.S. crop protection. And last year, we saw an increase of about 1.5 share points, most of that being organic growth. And so we're really pleased with how our business performed in the U.S.As you note, it was a very tight window. Once farmers eventually had a chance to plant their crop, our supply chain and service approach to our retail network really kicked in, and we saw a significant share increase. And so I would expect we led the way in same-store sales growth just based on that alone.""]",question_answer

Maybe you'd help me bridge for 2020. So are you assuming that you're getting some tailwinds here and maybe some lower cost per tonne? Are you assuming lower royalties? I know there's different credits that have been changing the government, change some of the ability to apply them. It also seems like you're maybe assuming a $15 to $30 a tonne potash price increase globally from spots through the year. Can you maybe comment on the different buckets?""]",question_answer
11,35,NTR.TO,NTR.TO_208052,4,2020-02-19 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2019,2019,1659,Charles Victor Magro,"[""Yes. Joel, so I'll try to give you the best perspective that we have. If you look at our overall guidance, and then we can dive -- have a deeper look at the Potash business, the lower end of our guidance would essentially have today's pricing moving forward through the year. We don't think that, that is a high likelihood, but that is how we've crafted the overall lower end of the guidance. The upper end of the guidance has, of course, price increases assumed through the year, but that the overall net pricing would be actually less than 2019. So that's how we get to the upper end of the guidance.So then when you look specifically at our Potash guidance, certainly, when you look at how we've sold our sales plan, that's based on our view that we're going to see some decent growth, moving up from 64.2 million tonnes, that's our guesstimate for 2019, up to 66 million to 68 million tonnes, and that's how we get our volume. So about 1 million tonnes of volume growth that we're assuming. And then when you look at our cash costs, we are assuming a slightly lower cash cost as we continue to optimize the potash network, grow volumes from Rocanville. So that's built into the guidance. And then the rest is really the market pricing, which we sort of bookend for you on a macro level from sort of today's pricing through to slightly less than last year's.We don't want to get too much more specific than that because I think that's probably enough said, but we have some confidence in our guidance ranges. I think the biggest wildcard that we have right now in Potash is when will the China contract be signed. And even that, I think we've taken a fairly conservative route where we believe that the contracts won't be settled now until the second quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, because of the port inventory build, but really because of the disruption from the coronavirus and not being able to get to the negotiating table as well as move port inventories in land. And we do think that that's going to have a bit of an impact into the second quarter.""]",question_answer

It does assume the 14 million acres of incremental seeded acreage in the U.S. that we've outlined. And so I think that you have to assume that the sales volumes that we've outlined in our guidance is key to the overall earnings. There's always a bunch of puts and takes in our industry. That's what agriculture is about. And I wouldn't want to overall rank them for you because I don't think that, that would be appropriate. And we wouldn't actually have a great understanding of which one is going to be most disruptive.I think given the situation in ag when we look at last year versus this year, last year, there was clearly a geopolitical and a macro backdrop that pressured not only Nutrien's earnings, but the entire sector. And the recovery that we saw really nicely shaping up in 2018, there was a reset. And now we think that 2020 will be that year of recovery. But because of the situation of how low prices went in the fourth quarter and as well as the inventory that was built, some in nitrogen, but also in potash, we think that we're going to see the recovery in 2020, we just don't know when.The coronavirus, just to give some commentary on that, obviously, we're watching it closely. Nobody really has the full impact understood right now. But where we're seeing that impact is on the contract negotiation with potash, which we've already talked about. But there's also some active ingredients for crop chemistry that are core to our supply chain, but many others that are quite tight right now. Now we have a very good inventory position for that. We don't think that that's going to impact us for the spring season.African swine fever, I think you mentioned that as well. We think that the worst is behind us there and that the herds are starting to rebuild. Certainly, I think when you look at the results for 2019, you are going to see that grain and oil seed demand was impacted because of that. But that headwind should become a tailwind as we move through 2020. And then, of course, the U.S.-China trade settlement, a major headwind for the last 2 years. But now that the settlement is agreed to, I know that there's some uncertainty on when we're going to start to see U.S. agricultural products start to shift to China at the higher levels, but we have confidence that, that will happen in 2020. We have confidence that that's going to be a major tailwind for us, but we don't know exactly the time. So that -- we're being a bit conservative because of all of these things. But most of the tailwinds from last year should -- or the headwinds from last year should become tailwinds for this year.""]",question_answer

So the situation is manageable for us right now. It's far from ideal, but we don't send a lot of cars east from our operations. So most of our production, as you know, is in the west. We don't use the east as a core exporting route. So the majority of our exports are going to be just fine.This is disappointing though, because we just got through a rail strike at CN in the fourth quarter and now we've got this slowdown in Canada. And so overall, we're watching the situation. We don't think it's going to have an impact to our deliveries right now. But the reliability of the Canadian supply chain is becoming a concern for us, and that's something that we're actively involved with the authorities to try to help them understand that this will impact Canadian agriculture and our reputation over time if this stuff continues.The carbon tax, we have a carbon tax already in Alberta. And it's for large emitters, but we have also a lot of offsets as well. So we have a cogen facility at one of our operations that allows us to have carbon tax credits. And we also have a relatively used carbon sequestration operation. That has been a fantastic investment for us, and that is helping offset some of the carbon tax.So what I would say right now is that we're in the new regime when it comes to carbon taxes certainly in Western Canada. It's something that's been with us for some time. I'd say, today, we don't see a significant impact to overall cost. And if we have found smart ways to offset our carbon taxes by making some, I think, strategic investments over time, and we'll watch the situation over time to see how things progress, but certainly, right now, we're quite comfortable that the Canadian assets are going to remain very competitive globally and, in fact, with AECO gas-related, probably some of the lowest cost reduction on the planet.""]",question_answer

Last year was primarily crop protection products. This year, we're adding seed ordering and fertilizer ordering capability onto the platform. And so that will, I think, generate additional revenue. And we've also added a number of other features to the platform that we're turning on in 2020. We recently turned on our crop planning tool, which allows our sales agronomists to sit down with our customers and plan their farm field by field across all inputs. It creates insights, both for our supply chain, but it also allows our sales agronomists to really work with our customers to provide those full acre solutions, including financing opportunities that we're now financing using Nutrien Financial, which is also integrated into the digital tool.So we're really creating a lot of convenience, digital insights from an agronomy standpoint.

Certainly, the setback last year when we had a reduction because of palm oil prices and then, of course, the U.S. weather impacted, before that, we were seeing very good growth. And we had a view that as the market continued to grow at its historical rate, it would require more supply, and the new entrant supply would fit pretty nicely into the increased demand. Obviously, in 2019, we had a reset. And I think Nutrien looked at our sales book, and we pulled back on our sales because, simply, we didn't have the customer base to support it.Now when we look at the 2020 plan, though, we're seeing what I would call a respectable growth, another 4% up from 2019 levels, getting back to basically 2018 levels. And so our plan, as outlined in my prepared remarks, is we are going to take our sales volumes up. And we think that it will be supported by growth in Southeast Asia and in North America. China is probably going to take a little less than they took last year. But overall, when we look at the sales plan that we've put forth, we think that the market is going to need the tonnes. And we're not sure exactly what others are planning or could do. But certainly, with the increased market that we see coming in 2020, depending on when we see a China settlement, our view strongly is that our sales plan makes a lot of sense for us and for our stakeholders.

If you go north of I-80, into the Dakotas and Minnesota, Wisconsin, obviously they had a really early winter hit them. Soil moistures, especially in South Dakota, are still high, but the ground is frozen.

Michael, look, if we kind of go through the major categories, and from a margin standpoint as we head into 2020, firstly, from a nutrient standpoint, we were pleased with the performance of our nutrient business last year. Our margin per tonnes were up $6 a tonne across our global retail business. In Q4 and early days here in 2020, we're seeing those margins hold, and so we anticipate similar margins on a per tonne basis in 2020 that we delivered in 2019.On CPs, we had a very challenging first half of the year in CP. There was a lot of inventory that was carried into early 2019 across the retail network, and then the market was really slow to evolve. And that put a lot of margin pressure. And of course, as we reported our first half earnings last year, it was reflected in our margins in crop protection. As we -- as the year unfolded, we really recovered significantly, and we ended up holding our margins -- our gross margins pretty flat year-over-year.And so as we head into 2020, I would actually anticipate some positive opportunities on crop protection margins. We don't anticipate the delayed spring. I think channel inventories, including our own, have drawn down this time this year versus this time last year. And that should all be conducive to more regular levels of competition and opportunities for us from a margin standpoint.We also saw, just on the crop protection before I leave that, we also saw a little bit of a decline in our mix of proprietary products last year. And again, a lot of that was based on inventory that we had, that we wanted to sell the inventories that we had in our sheds. And so as we look at 2020, we would anticipate our mix of proprietary products to get back to where we were a year earlier, and that will also be constructive to margins.Finally, on the seed side, we are seeing to date margins on corn seed at pretty historic levels. And so -- and with more corn acres to be planted, that's going to be good for our seed margins. Soybean seed is probably where there's more competition this year. And so we're seeing a bit of margin erosion in our soybean seed business. So I would say that's probably the one area that we're watching out for. But overall, I think if you look at seed on an all-in basis, we'll likely be in similar margins as we've been historically, especially with more corn acres coming in.""]",question_answer

And so the pricing mechanism for those provisionally shipped volumes will be that they're awaiting a new contract, which is relevant because, in fact, Canpotex is not the only supplier. So that when we look at port inventories in China and say, 3.5 million tonnes, well, about 1.5 million -- 1 million of those tonnes now are awaiting a new contract. And that new contract price will be the price for those provisionally shipped volumes.""]",question_answer

So the impact from the M&A for -- on 2019 was somewhere between $35 million and $40 million. As you know, we didn't close Ruralco until October, so that was really the driving difference, I think, between 2019 and 2020 as well as we have several of the other tuck-ins that will start to show benefit in 2020. So to answer your question, somewhere between $35 million and $40 million.""]",question_answer
